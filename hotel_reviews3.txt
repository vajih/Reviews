Title: Disappointing Experience at the Disorganized Horizon Hotel

Rating: ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)

I recently had the unfortunate experience of staying at the Horizon Hotel during my trip to Istanbul, and I must say that it was a major letdown. From the moment I arrived until the day of my departure, there were numerous issues that marred my stay and left me feeling unsatisfied.

To begin with, the check-in process was disorganized and time-consuming. Despite having made a reservation well in advance, I had to wait in a long queue before being attended to by the front desk staff. Their lack of efficiency and attentiveness was frustrating, and it set a negative tone for the rest of my stay.

The condition of my room was far from satisfactory. The cleanliness was subpar, with visible dust on surfaces and a stale odor in the air. The linens and towels provided were worn out and looked shabby. The overall maintenance of the room seemed neglected, as I encountered issues with faulty plumbing and a malfunctioning air conditioning unit. Despite notifying the staff, the problems were not adequately addressed, which added to my disappointment.

The hotel amenities were also disappointing. The fitness center, which was advertised as state-of-the-art, was outdated and poorly maintained. The equipment was in need of repair, and the overall cleanliness of the facility was questionable. Additionally, the Wi-Fi connection was unreliable and slow, making it difficult to stay connected or get any work done during my stay.

One of the most disappointing aspects was the dining experience. The quality of the food served at the hotel's restaurant was below average. The limited menu options lacked variety and creativity, and the taste of the dishes was underwhelming. The service at the restaurant was also lackluster, with unresponsive waitstaff and long waiting times for orders to be taken and delivered.

The location of the Horizon Hotel was another drawback. It was far from the city center and major attractions, making it inconvenient for exploring the city. The lack of nearby public transportation options made getting around a hassle, and the surrounding area did not offer much in terms of dining or entertainment options.

In conclusion, my stay at the Horizon Hotel was a disappointing experience filled with numerous shortcomings. From the disorganized check-in process to the poorly maintained room and lackluster amenities, it fell far below my expectations. The subpar dining options and inconvenient location further added to my dissatisfaction. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a comfortable and enjoyable stay. There are undoubtedly better options available in Istanbul that provide superior service and value for money.
